	Decryption and Encryption utility for the commandline

This code will decrypt and encrypt files using AES using Block Cipher

To call this code, run it like this:
java -jar ./out/artifacts/PhotoEncrypter_jar/PhotoEncrypter.jar -h

 Idea will create the .jar file artifact. If you want to run this without
artifacts, this is the commandline to run:

java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -classpath ./out/production/PhotoEncrypter com.eggwall.android.photoviewer.Main  -h
